Changes in synthPop version 0.2.4
  * feature: generate colored mosaic plots in spMosaic()
  * fix: missing argument and code-mismatch in simRelation()

Changes in synthPop version 0.2.3
  * fix in simContinuous() reported by Oliver

Changes in synthPop version 0.2.2
  * new parameter 'nr_cpus' for calibPop(), simCategorical(), simContinuous() and simRelation() manually defining how many cpus should be used
  * updated man-pages
  * new helper-function 'parallelParameters()' returing a list with parameters 'have_win', 'parallel' and 'nr_cores'
  * fixed a bug in simCategorical if only one additional variable is simulated

Changes in synthPop version 0.2.1
  * fixed a bug in simContinuous (win only) reported by olivier.

Changes in synthPop version 0.2.0
  * version drop for final delivery

Changes in synthPop version 0.1.9
  * allow more userfriendly input for calibSample()
  * calibSample() can be applied to objects of class 'synthPopObj'
  * updated example for ipu
  * whipple index (original and modified) included
  * sprague index included
  * simInitSpatial() to generate districts from a broader region
  * dataObj-methods for covWt() and corWt()
  * dataObj-methods for meanWt() and varWt()
  * method addWeights<- to modify sampling weights based on output from calibSample()
  * dataObj-method for quantileWt()
  * updated default parameters for calibPop(). Previous choices for starting temperature were much to high and too many worse solution were accepted.
  * fixed example for calibPop()
  * new accessor/set functions sampleData, sampleObj, sampleObj<-, popData, popObj, popObj<-, tableObj with updated man-page

Changes in synthPop version 0.1.8
  * remove S3-class spBwplot() -> only default method was implemented. Removed option to supply a list of populations; rewritten to use 'synthPopObj'-objects

  * fixed man files for spBwplot() and spBwplotStats()

  * updated calibPop() so that the function uses and returns objects of class 'synthPopObj'

  * auxData()-methods to query/set 'sample' slot in 'synthPopObj'-objects

Changes in synthPop version 0.1.7
  * parallel-computing on windows-platforms using doParallel-package

  * removed spTable.formula method (did not work correctly, anyway)

  * parallel processing on windows using doParallel-package and foreach with %dopar%

  * fixed a problem in calibPop.cpp where export of params-object in a list was not done correctly

  * refactorization of calibPop.R to allow parallel computing

Changes in synthPop version 0.1.6
  * removed method 'ctree' from simCategorical() -> perhaps add it later

  * removed argument 'basic' from simCategorical(). The function now uses variables listed in slot @basicHHvars of the input object of class 'synthPopObj'.

  * made check that slot basicHHvars after simStructure() contains at least one variable.

  * new utility-function manageSynthPopObj() to get/set variables in objects of class 'synthPopObj'
  * updated a lot of Rd-Files with (now) working examples

  * updated simEUSILC()

Changes in synthPop version 0.1.5
  * combined classes 'sampleObj' and 'popObj' into 'dataObj'

  * renamed specify_sample() to specifyInput()

  * adjusted NAMESPACE files, documentation and functions to reflect these changes

  * Parallelization of simContinous() on non-windows platforms

  * porting simContinous() to use new class 'synthPopObj' as input


Changes in synthPop version 0.1.4
  * starting to use new classes 'sampleObj', 'popObj' and 'synthPopObj' for the entire package

  * various fixes and improvements such as a new c++ implementation of calibVars()

  * cleanup dependencies in DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE

  * remove method 'liblinear' from simCategorical() - has never really worked

Changes in synthPop version 0.1.3
  * parallelize simRelevation() on non-windows platforms

  * c++ algorithm for simulated annealing in calibPop()

  * multiple commits to fix documentation and cran-notes/warnings when checking

Changes in synthPop version 0.1.2
  * temporarily add explicit parallel-option to calibPop() for testing-purposes

  * more efficient implementation of auxiliary-function resample() used in calibPop()

  * changed default setting for auxiliary-variable 'factor' in calibPop() which now allows the algorithm to terminate in an accceptable time

  * added R/zzz.R to get current package version on loading the package

Changes in synthPop version 0.1.1
  * more efficient c++ implementation of iterative proportional updating

  * multiple imports from package simPopulation

  * reorganizations (simAnnealing -> synthPop,...)

Changes in synthPop version 0.1.0

  + code largely based on version 0.4.1 of simPopulation

  + use package parallel if possible for some functions (non-windows platforms)

  + first version of simulated annealing

  + first (very rough) version of IPU (iterative proportional updating)

  + remove vignette from simPopulation

  + update Citation

  + new methods for simCategorical (naivebayes, ctree and liblinear)
