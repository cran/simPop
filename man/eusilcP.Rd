\details{
The data set is used as population data in some of the examples in package 
\code{simFrame}.  Note that it is included for illustrative purposes only.  It 
consists of 25 000 households, hence it does not represent the true population 
sizes of Austria and its regions.

Only a few of the large number of variables in the original survey are included 
in this example data set.  Some variable names are different from the 
standardized names used by the statistical agencies, as the latter are rather 
cryptic codes.  Furthermore, the variables \code{hsize}, \code{eqsize}, 
\code{eqIncome} and \code{age} are not included in the standardized format of 
EU-SILC data, but have been derived from other variables for convenience.  
Moreover, some very sparse income components were not included in the the 
generation of this synthetic data set. Thus the equivalized household income is 
computed from the available income components.
